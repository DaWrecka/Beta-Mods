Usage
Batch files must be located in the mod's directory, alongside ConsoleBatchFiles.dll and mod.json. Batch files may have any name, but must be plain text format. Each command must be on a new line, by itself.
Executing the commands contained within a batch file is done using one of the following methods:
	exec <filename>
	bat <filename>
	batch <filename>
If an extension is not specified in the supplied filename, the mod will assume an extension of .txt, making it possible to execute the above batch file with exec Seamoth. This does have the effect of making it impossible to use filenames that don't have extensions, but using extensions isn't a bad practice anyway.

Case sensitivity depends on your operating system; under Windows for example,
	exec Seamoth.txt
and
	exec seamoth.txt
would be equally-valid and execute the same file; if you're running SN in Linux or MacOS, this will not be the case.

====================================================================================================================================================
As of version 1.1, the processing of the batch file has been changed to an coroutine. This allows for a new command, valid only within a batch file:

wait X

X is the number of seconds to pause before processing the next command in the batch.
