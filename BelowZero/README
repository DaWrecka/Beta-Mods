AutosortLockersSML
	A BZ conversion of PrimeSonic's conversion of RandyKnapp's Autosort Lockers
ConsoleBatchFiles
	A BZ recompilation of my mod Console Batch Files, which allows lists of console commands to be gathered in text files then executed in-game with a single command.
CustomiseOxygen
	A mod for customising capacities of oxygen tanks. Also contains a mode harkening back to newman55's SN1 mod Refillable Oxygen Tanks
CustomiseYourStorage_BZ
	A mod for customising capacities of storage lockers, including modded lockers.
HabitatBuilderSpeed
	Increases or decreases the time taken required to build objects with the Habitat Builder
PartsFromScanning_BZ
	A conversion of my mod Ingredients from Scanning; scanning fragments you already have the blueprint for will grant ingredients from that recipe.
RecyclotronModSupport
	By default, the Recyclotron cannot be used to deconstruct certain items, mostly modded items, because the method CraftData.GetTechType fails to return a TechType for modded items. This mod re-implements the Recyclotron's GetIngredients method to get the TechType a different way, allowing some - not all - modded items to be recycled.
