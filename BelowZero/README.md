A mod inspired by Alexejhero's More Modified Items. As of 2021-03-22, has the following items:
The following are crafted from the Workbench:
* High Capacity Booster Tank: Booster tank with capacity of High Capacity Tank
* Plasteel High Capacity Tank: a duplication of the Lightweight Ultra High Capacity Tank. Not currently-craftable.
* Ultra Glide Swim Charge Fins: a duplication of the same from More Modified Items.
* Ultra Glide Fins: Vanilla recipe enabled

The following are crafted from the new Suit Upgrades tab in Workbench:
* Reinforced Cold Suit: combination of Cold Suit and Reinforced Dive Suit. Has body suit and gloves. Unlocked with both Cold Suit and Reinforced Dive Suit.
* Insulated Rebreather: Combination of Rebreather and Cold Helmet. Unlocked when both Cold Suit and Rebreather are unlocked.
* Survival Suit: upgraded Stillsuit which passively regenerates food and water, instead of dumping water packs in inventory. Unlocked with Stillsuit.
* Insulated Survival Suit: combination of Survival Suit and Cold Suit. Unlocked with same.
* Reinforced Survival Suit: Combination of Reinforced Dive Suit and Survival Suit, unlocked with same.
* Ultimate Survival Suit: combination of Reinforced Dive Suit, Cold Suit, and Survival Suit. Can be crafted from Reinforced Suit, Cold Suit, and Survival Suit, or from one of the combinations and its third part. (e.g. Insulated Survival Suit + Reinforced Dive Suit)

The following are crafted from the Machines section of the Fabricator:
* Powerglide: unlocked by scanning fragments. (see below for list of spawn biomes) Holding Shift provides significant speed bonus, although at significant energy cost.

The following are crafted from the Upgrades section of the Fabricator:  (Hoverbike modules are all unlocked with the Hoverbike)
* Snowfox Engine Efficiency Module: Reduces Snowfox energy consumption
* Snowfox Solar Charger Module: Recharges Snowfox battery while in sunlight.
* Snowfox Speed Module: Increases Snowfox speed, but increases energy consumption while moving.
* Snowfox Structural Integrity Module: reduces damage taken by Snowfox, but consumes energy to do so.
* Snowfox Self-Repair Module: Slow passive repair of damage to the Snowfox. Costs energy.
* Snowfox Durability Module: Made by combining the Structural Integrity and Self-Repair Modules.
* Snowfox Water Travel Module: allows Snowfox to travel over water
* Snowfox Mobility Upgrade: Combination of Engine Efficiency, Speed, Water Travel, and Jump modules; Supercedes Speed and Efficiency modules; does not provide as large a benefit as either module, but energy consumption is reduced compared to individual modules.

The following are crafted from the Vehicle Upgrade Console fabricator:
* Exosuit Lightning Claw Generator: when equipped, attacks with the Exosuit's claw inflict Electrical damage, instantly repelling most marine fauna, including Leviathans.
* Seatruck Solar Module: Charges power cells when Seatruck is within 200m of the surface. May be stacked up to four times.
* Seatruck Thermal Module: Charges power cells when Seatruck is in hot areas. (25C or higher) Not stackable.
* Seatruck Sonar Module: Press the associated hotkey to toggle the module; press it a second time to toggle it off. Otherwise acts exactly as the Seamoth sonar module did in SN1.

The following are crafted from a new tab in the Personal>Equipment tab of the Fabricator:
* Diver Perimeter Defence Chip: a chip which inflicts electrical damage on predators just before they inflict damage. This is enough to temporarily-repel everything up to and including a Void Leviathan; however, the chip only works once and is then burned out. Mk2 and Mk3 versions are available.

Powerglide fragments spawn in the following biomes:
	LilyPads_Deep_Grass
	LilyPads_Deep_Ground
	MiningSite_Ground
	PurpleVents_Deep_Pool_Voxel
	TwistyBridges_Cave_Ground

However, these fragments are scarce.
A databox is also available; It can be found in dGhlIE1lcmN1cnkgSUkgYm93LCBpbiB0aGUgTGlseSBQYWRz. (Base64 to decode)

KNOWN BUGS
* Completing the Powerglide blueprint from fragments provides no message - it's only discernible from an incomplete scan by the *lack* of a message.

## ConsoleBatchFiles
A BZ recompilation of my mod Console Batch Files, which allows lists of console commands to be gathered in text files then executed in-game with a single command.
## CustomiseOxygen
A mod for customising capacities of oxygen tanks. Also contains a mode harkening back to newman55's SN1 mod Refillable Oxygen Tanks
## CustomiseYourStorage_BZ
A mod for customising capacities of storage lockers, including modded lockers.
## FuelCells (requires CustomBatteries)
Adds mid-game batteries, by default positioned somewhere between standard and ion batteries. Also enables Lithium Ion Batteries and Power Cells as minor upgrades to the standard cells.
	Requires CustomBatteries.
## GravTrapBeacons
Adds beacons to Grav Traps, and allows them to be seen from any distance.
CAUTION: Whether or not a grav trap remains visible from long distances following a game reload is untested. To be safe, do not save if you have a grav trap at distance greater than 40m.
Compatible with Improved Grav Traps.
## HabitatBuilderSpeed
Increases or decreases the time taken required to build objects with the Habitat Builder. Fully-configurable from in-game options.
## PartsFromScanning
A conversion of my mod Ingredients from Scanning; scanning fragments you already have the blueprint for will grant ingredients from that recipe.
## RecyclotronModSupport
By default, the Recyclotron cannot be used to deconstruct certain items, mostly modded items, because the method CraftData.GetTechType fails to return a TechType for modded items. This mod re-implements the Recyclotron's GetIngredients method to get the TechType a different way, allowing some - not all - modded items to be recycled.
## UnlockCustomisation
Customise what blueprints unlock and when. Samples and help can be found in the config files.
## Power Over Your Power
Customise capacities of vanilla batteries. Could be used to customise mod batteries too, but this should only be done if they have no configuration themselves.

A BZ conversion of Lee23's Wind Turbines.
