Powerglide fragments spawn in the following biomes:

However, these fragments are scarce.

KNOWN BUGS
* Completing the Powerglide blueprint from fragments provides no message - it's only discernible from an incomplete scan by the *lack* of a message.
## ConsoleBatchFiles
A BZ recompilation of my mod Console Batch Files, which allows lists of console commands to be gathered in text files then executed in-game with a single command.
## CustomiseOxygen
A mod for customising capacities of oxygen tanks. Also contains a mode harkening back to newman55's SN1 mod Refillable Oxygen Tanks
## CustomiseYourStorage
A mod for customising capacities of storage lockers, including modded lockers.
## FuelCells (requires CustomBatteries)
Adds mid-game batteries, by default positioned somewhere between standard and ion batteries. Also enables Lithium Ion Batteries and Power Cells as minor upgrades to the standard cells.
	Requires CustomBatteries.
## GravTrapBeacons
Adds beacons to Grav Traps, and allows them to be seen from any distance.
Compatible with Improved Grav Traps.
## HabitatBuilderSpeed
Increases or decreases the time taken required to build objects with the Habitat Builder. Fully-configurable from in-game options.
## PartsFromScanning
A conversion of my mod Ingredients from Scanning; scanning fragments you already have the blueprint for will grant ingredients from that recipe.
## TrueSolarPowerCells
Changes the solar power cells in the Escape Pod so that they actually charge from the sun, at a comparable rate to a craftable solar panel.
## UnlockCustomisation
Customise what blueprints unlock and when. Samples and help can be found in the config files.
## Power Over Your Power
Customise capacities of vanilla batteries. Could be used to customise mod batteries too, but this should only be done if they have no configuration themselves.
## Unaggressive Flora
Makes Spike Plants ignore players. They may still target fauna, just not players.
