## BrineSuit
DELETED - has been integrated into DWEquipmentBonanza
## DWEquipmentBonanza (requires CustomDataboxes)
A mod inspired by Alexejhero's More Modified Items. As of 2021-03-22, has the following items:
The following are crafted from the Workbench:
* Plasteel High Capacity Tank: a duplication of the Lightweight Ultra High Capacity Tank. Not currently-craftable.
* Ultra Glide Swim Charge Fins: a duplication of the same from More Modified Items.

The following are crafted from the new Suit Upgrades tab in Workbench:
* Brine Suit: combination of Radiation Suit and Reinforced Dive Suit. Has body suit, helmet and gloves. Unlocked with both Radiation Suit and Reinforced Dive Suit. Provides immunity to corrosive damage, including acid mushrooms and the corrosive brine in the Lost River.
* Survival Suit: upgraded Stillsuit which passively regenerates food and water, instead of dumping water packs in inventory. Unlocked with Stillsuit.
* Ultimate Survival Suit: combination of Brine Suit and Survival Suit.

The following are crafted from the Machines section of the Fabricator:
* Powerglide: unlocked by scanning fragments or databox. (see below for list of spawn biomes) Holding Shift provides significant speed bonus, although at significant energy cost.

The following are crafted from the Vehicle Upgrade Console fabricator:
* Exosuit Lightning Claw Generator: when equipped, attacks with the Exosuit's claw inflict Electrical damage, instantly repelling most marine fauna, including Leviathans.

The following are crafted from a new tab in the Personal>Equipment tab of the Fabricator:
* Diver Perimeter Defence Chip: a chip which inflicts electrical damage on predators just before they inflict damage. This is enough to repel everything up to and including a Void Chelicerate; however, the chip only works once and is then burned out. Mk2 and Mk3 versions are available.

Powerglide fragments spawn in the following biomes:
	Dunes_TechSite
	Mountains_TechSite
	SeaTreaderPath_TechSite
	SparseReef_Techsite
	UnderwaterIslands_TechSite

However, these fragments are scarce.
A databox is also available; It can be found aW4gd3JlY2s2LCBpbiB0aGUgRHVuZXMuIFRoaXMgaXMgdGhlIGxhcmdlc3Qgd3JlY2sgaW4gdGhlIGJpb21l. (Base64 to decode)

KNOWN BUGS
* Completing the Powerglide blueprint from fragments provides no message - it's only discernible from an incomplete scan by the *lack* of a message.
## ConsoleBatchFiles
A BZ recompilation of my mod Console Batch Files, which allows lists of console commands to be gathered in text files then executed in-game with a single command.
## CustomiseOxygen
A mod for customising capacities of oxygen tanks. Also contains a mode harkening back to newman55's SN1 mod Refillable Oxygen Tanks
## CustomiseYourStorage
A mod for customising capacities of storage lockers, including modded lockers.
## FuelCells (requires CustomBatteries)
Adds mid-game batteries, by default positioned somewhere between standard and ion batteries. Also enables Lithium Ion Batteries and Power Cells as minor upgrades to the standard cells, and code which can be used to change the capacities of vanilla batteries/power cells. (documentation to follow)
	Requires CustomBatteries.
## GravTrapBeacons
Adds beacons to Grav Traps, and allows them to be seen from any distance.
CAUTION: Whether or not a grav trap remains visible from long distances following a game reload is untested. To be safe, do not save if you have a grav trap at distance greater than 40m.
Compatible with Improved Grav Traps.
## HabitatBuilderSpeed
Increases or decreases the time taken required to build objects with the Habitat Builder. Fully-configurable from in-game options.
## PartsFromScanning
A conversion of my mod Ingredients from Scanning; scanning fragments you already have the blueprint for will grant ingredients from that recipe.
## TrueSolarPowerCells
Changes the solar power cells in the Escape Pod so that they actually charge from the sun, at a comparable rate to a craftable solar panel.
